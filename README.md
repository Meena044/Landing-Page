## What I Learned

Through building this project, I learned how to:

- Use **Flexbox** to position containers exactly where I want them
- Apply `justify-content` and `align-items` to align elements horizontally and vertically
- Use `flex-wrap` to allow content to wrap on smaller screens without breaking the layout
- Set `padding` to create space **inside** elements
- Set `margin` to create space **outside** and between elements
- Make layouts **responsive** using percentage-based widths

This project gave me hands-on experience with building layouts that adjust fluidly as the screen size changes.

## ðŸŽ¨ Fun Fact

All the artwork used in this landing page â€” was hand-drawn by me!  
This project combines both my coding and artistic skills into one creative space.
